This controller allows the ghost to do standard movement through the use of a joystick, as is in the original pacman game. However, it also allows players to use tilt controls to move in any direction as well. The controller also supports one button that allows the ghost to jump in order to avoid being eaten (the jump is on a cool down for balancing reasons). There are also 2 vibration motors, one for each hand, that vibrates when pacman eats you for added effect.  

The controller itself is shaped like the ghosts that players control and is designed to be held in two hands and is rounded on the edges in order to be more comfortable. For added flair, the joystick and buttons are placed on the controller as if they were the ghost's eyes.    

Assembly:  

The controller consists of a top, bottom and button. The button is placed through the right most hole and is supported by the tact switch and platform underneath. The top and bottom are simply connected together.  

Improvements:  

This prototype is not perfect. The back of the controller could be better shaped to fit human hands that are holding it. There can also be more internal pieces to hold everything in place.
